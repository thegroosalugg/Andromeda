  mercury:
    'Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the Sun. Its surface is covered in craters and has extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from scorching heat during the day to freezing cold at night. Mercury has no atmosphere to speak of and completes a full orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.',

  venus:
    "Venus is often called Earth's 'sister planet' due to its similar size and composition. However, its thick, toxic atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide, creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. Venus has a landscape filled with volcanoes and deformed mountains, and its surface pressure is crushingly high.",

  earth:
    "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only one known to harbor life. It has a diverse climate, vast oceans, and rich ecosystems that support millions of species. Earth's atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and oxygen, protects life by filtering harmful solar radiation and regulating temperature. The planet's geological activity, including tectonic movements, shapes its dynamic surface.",

  mars: "Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide on its surface. Mars has the tallest volcano, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris, in the solar system. Its thin atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide, and although it's cold and arid, evidence suggests that liquid water once flowed on its surface.",

  jupiter:
    "Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, a gas giant with a mass more than twice that of all the other planets combined. It has a turbulent atmosphere with powerful storms, including the Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries. Jupiter's strong magnetic field and dozens of moons, including the potentially ocean-harboring Europa, make it a fascinating planet.",

  saturn:
    'Saturn is best known for its spectacular ring system, made up of countless ice particles, rock debris, and dust. It is the second-largest planet in the solar system and, like Jupiter, is a gas giant with a thick atmosphere composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn has over 80 moons, including Titan, which has a dense atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane.',

  uranus:
    'Uranus is unique among the planets because it rotates on its side, likely due to a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. This ice giant has a pale blue color, a result of methane in its atmosphere. Uranus has faint rings and 27 known moons, and it experiences extreme seasonal variations as it orbits the Sun on its tilted axis.',

  neptune:
    'Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is known for its striking blue color and fierce winds, the fastest in the solar system. This ice giant has a thick atmosphere of hydrogen, helium, and methane, and a core composed of rock and metal. Neptune has a complex ring system and 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest, featuring geysers that erupt with nitrogen gas.',
